# What is a senior engineer

I have been thinking a lot about this topic over the last little while. What makes a senior engineer? Is it time in the industry? Time at a company? Experience with particular technologies? Code output? Code Quality?

While I think that these things definitely help someone make a case that they are no longer a Junior or Mid level engineer. I don't think that looking at any one of these in isolation makes a senior engineer. Instead I think there are a number of factor when combined that make up a senior engineer.

This isn't designed to be an all encompassing list of what a senior engineer is, but it is designed to represent a list of skills and attributes that I believe are desirable for all seniors. This is very important, as I believe that individual companies and even individual teams need different things from seniors and only you can figure that out. This list does represent a good starting point however.

So what skills and attributes do I think are important for senior engineers?

- Impact, how does the work you do impact, your team or the whole company?
- Mentoring, are you able to efficiently train others?
- Knowledge, do you actually know what you are doing?
- Amenable, are you able to be wrong / change your opinion?
- Empathetic, can you put yourself in someone elses position / understand where they are coming from?
- Experience, how much have you seen / done?

## Impact

This is one of the most important points in my opinion. What do I mean by impact? Well what does the work you perform do?

I think that a good senior engineer brings ideas to a team or a business that changes the way that things are done. Their ideas influence a large audience or change a crucial way that something complex is done.

If you think about the amount of time during a week, an individual contributor is probably spending 4 - 6 hours a day in focused work, lets take the upper limit there of 6 hours and convert it into an imaginary unit of work. Then extrapolate that out to an entire weeks worth of work units. As an individual contributor the maximum number of productive work units you are could expect to be completing during a week is 30.

Now lets think about a team of engineers, there are 5 engineers on the team. Each engineer on the team is hitting this 6 work units a day 5 days a week. The teams output is 150 work units a week.

We now have this finite, tangible number of work units that this team can perform within a week. So lets think about what a senior engineers impact could be in this team. Maybe they suggest 3 changes to the way things are done that increase the output of these 5 engineers by 15%. Maybe it's in the way that the codebase is structured, or maybe it's in the way that the code is deployed. What does our hypothetical teams weekly output look like now.

150 work units increased by 15% would now be 172.5 work units. That is 22.5 extra work units. So lets bring this back to hours worked. If you as an individual contributor wanted to bring the teams output up by the same amount, you would essentially need to work two weeks in one.
